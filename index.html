            <h3>A brief discription of the web developer's Education background</h3>
            <p>My study background is as below:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><B>2007-2013:</B> I attended my Primary Level Education from <B>Redeemer Children's Primary School, Adjumani, Uganda</B></li><br>
                <li><B>2014-2015:</B> I then joined <b>Gulu Central High School, GULU</b> for my Secondary Education. Due to personal reasons, and difference in preferences of
                environment, and poor teaching, I only spent two (2) years there. Early 2016, I left for Kampala City where I continued with the other classes!</li><br>
                <li><b>2016-2017:</b> Early in 2016, I headed to <b>Kampala</b> for that is where I had decided to go complete my other levels of Secondary Education (SE). I got
                admitted at <b>Nakasero Senior School-Lubaga</b> where I completed both levels, Form 3 and 4.</li><br>
                <li><b>2018-2019:</b> I then joined <b>Merryland High Schools-Entebbe</b> in Feb. of <b>2018</b> for my Advanced Level Education.</li><br>
                <li>And later in <b>December 2021</b>, I got admitted at <b>Multitech Business School (MBS)</b>, for a <b>Diploma</b> course in <i>Information Technology (I.T).</i> It will be
                a 2 year long course we kicked off Jan. 24<sup>th</sup> if I recall well, and ended <b>May</b> 8<sup>th</sup>, and the "Springbreak", how
                I loved to call it, was something close to <b>4 months</b> because our second semester started <b>September</b> 5<sup>th</sup>, <b>2022.</b></li>
