        <h3>Below are some of the benefits of hiking to your physical health. While some
        of the physical benefits may be obvious – like weight loss – hiking has some surprising perks.</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>"HIKING IS GOOD FOR THE HEART".</b> Hiking is great for cardiovascular health. Even light hiking can raise the heart rate to a
                moderate level which helps improve aerobic fitness and endurance. Over time, your body adjusts to new fitness levels and you can hike
                longer, faster, and harder without feeling as fatigued or out of breath.<br><br> Hiking can also improve markers associated with
                cardiovascular health like blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and cholesterol. Studies have shown that going on regular moderate
                hikes can significantly reduce hypertension, improve glucose tolerance, and decrease ‘bad’ cholesterol levels over time.<br><br> So if
                cardiovascular health is a concern for you, hiking can be a great way to improve your heart health! Hiking is a fantastic way to
                build strength, improve fitness, and cultivate mental health. Learn more about the physical and mental benefits of hiking.</li><br>
                <li><b>"HIKING IMPROVES BALANCE".</b> I’ll start by sharing that balance hasn’t always been my strong suit, and crossing streams and
                boulder fields can give me anxiety. That’s one reason I love hiking with trekking poles. However, every time I challenge myself on that
                kind of terrain, I notice my balance improving, and by the end of summer, I’m much better at trusting my balance. But it isn’t just
                practice that makes perfect here. There is actually science behind this.<br><br> As you walk along a trail, your leg and core muscles
                are constantly engaging and contracting to provide stability and balance over uneven terrain. As these core stabilizing muscles strengthen
                 over time, balance improves.<br><br> But it’s not just stabilizing muscles that improve balance. Hiking also helps increase proprioception,
                  which is the mind’s awareness of the position and movement of the body in relation to its surroundings. As you hike, the brain is processing
                   every rock and root and gauging what it will take to step over obstacles. With practice, the brain becomes more adept at judging these
                   obstacles, and as a result, balance improves.<br><br> As we get older, it’s really important to keep working on balance in order to prevent
                    falls. Hiking is a fun way to improve balance while spending time in the outdoors.<br><br> Hiking is a fantastic way to build strength,
                    improve fitness, and cultivate mental health. Learn more about the physical and mental benefits of hiking.</li><br>
                <li><b>"HIKING HELPS BUILD MUSCLE".</b> As we touched on above, one benefits of hiking is it helps build stabilizing muscles in the legs
                and core to improve balance. But hiking also strengthens other muscles of the body including the arms and back. In fact, hiking is great
                exercise for almost every major muscle group in the body! Walking uphill engages the glutes, quads, hamstrings, and calves while hiking
                downhill engages the ankles, hips, and core.<br><br> The arm and back muscles can be strengthened while hiking through the use of trekking
                 poles or carrying a moderate to heavy pack(Learn how to choose a good hiking pack here).<br><br>So if going to the gym isn’t your idea of
                 fun, give hiking a try! It’s a great workout for the whole body and as we’ll talk about below, it’s a great way to calm the mind and release
                  stress too.</li><br>
                <li><b>"HIKING CAN INCREASE BONE DENSITY".</b> Bone density refers to the amount of bone mineral in your bones. High bone density is important
                 for preventing broken bones and reducing risk for osteoporosis. High impact and weight-bearing activities like hiking help to improve bone
                 density by strengthening the bone tissue.<br><br>But in order for these activities to be effective in increasing bone density, they need to
                 be done at a moderate to high-level. For example, the physical impact of hiking up a steep trail is more beneficial to building bone density
                 than hiking along a flat trail.</li><br>
                <li><b>"HIKING HELPS WITH WEIGHT LOSS".</b> While this might not be everyone’s goal, if you do want to lose weight, hiking is a great way to do it.
                I lost nearly 40 pounds hiking and had a blast doing it (ok it wasn’t all fun, but it was worlds better than the gym).<br><br>The number of calories
                 burned during a hike depends on a lot of factors like weight, gender, and aerobic intensity, but if you’re just starting out, even light hiking can
                  result in gradual weight loss.<br><br>The recommendation for physical activity for adults is at least 150 minutes (2.5 hours) per week. If your
                  goal is weight loss, try starting out with three 50 minute hikes per week on a local trail.<br><br>I first started hiking back in 2006 when I spent
                   a summer on the Big Island of Hawaii. It helped me lose weight and drastically improved my self-esteem.</li><br>
                <li><b>"HIKING EASES STRESS AND BOOSTS MENTAL WELLBEING".</b> There’s a lot of research supporting the notion that connecting with nature improves
                mental health and wellbeing. Whether we are taking in the spectacular glow of a sunset or gazing out at a field of wildflowers, these brief experiences
                 of feeling “wowed” by nature can make us feel happy and less stressed.<br><br>Forest bathing is a good example. This Japanese practice involves taking
                  a walk or hike in the woods as a way to reconnect with nature and disconnect from the digital world. Spending time in nature can evoke “a reduced sense
                   of self-importance relative to something larger and more powerful” says Paul Piff, assistant professor of psychology and social behavior at UC Irvine.
                   This feeling can melt away stress and elicit a more positive outlook on life.<br><br>In today’s world, stress and mental illness like depression and
                   anxiety are part of everyday life for many people. But spending time in nature can help bring us back to the present and evoke a sense of calm and
                   peace to our otherwise hectic lives.</li>
