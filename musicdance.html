        <h3><i>Here are 5 benefits of music, movement and dance that are worth knowing</i>!</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>"IT ENHANCES COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT".</b> Numerous early childhood studies have found that movement promotes a child’s brain development.
                Ms Gill Connell, a globally renowned child development expert, explained through her book “A Moving Child Is a
                Learning Child: How Movement Prepares a Child to Think” how movement aids in sensorial and brain development.<br><br>
                Another study by Neuroscientist Wendy Suzuki shows movement strengthens both the prefrontal cortex (which is
                involved in executivefunctioning) and the hippocampus (which plays a key role in memory and learning).<br><br> In short,
                it’s important to engage your child in movement-based activities such as dance to spur their brain development.</li><br>
                <li><b>"IT NURTURES SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL SKILLS".</b> Children can pick up obvious and subtle social cues and skills during music
                and movement classes, as it helps to sharpen focus and a sense of attention.<br><br>How do you navigate your personal space when you
                are in a group? What do you say when you bump into somebody? Moving together, sharing space and giving way to others, all these help to nurture
                a child’s social skills.<br><br> Dance is an especially powerful medium to build emotional intelligence, as it cultivates appropriate facial and
                bodily expressions which are important life skills. If you are considering sending your child to learn dance, the most established and reputable
                dance syllabus is the British-founded Royal Academy of Dance.</li><br>
                <li><b>"IT STRENGTHENS MOTOR SKILLS AND DEVELOPMENT".</b> When toddlers hop, run or skip, they’re not just moving their bodies aimlessly. The
                next time you see your child moving around, know this – their muscles are being developed, their bones are being strengthened, and their gross
                motor and fine motor skills are being honed.<br><br> Bodily actions like skipping from left to right, balancing on one leg, touching their left
                knee with their right hand – all these eye-hand coordination movements hone their balance, coordination and control.<br><br> Motor skills development is
                especially important in a child’s early years from 0 to 6 years old. As such, it is one of the main areas of development specified in the Nurturing
                Early Learners Framework developed by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA).</li><br>
                <li><b>"IT GROWS AESTHETIC AND CREATIVE EXPRESSION".</b> How can kids express themselves without words? This is where dance and music come in.
                It’s a safe platform for them when they find it difficult to express themselves through spoken or written language, building on a repertoire of
                emotional and creative skills.<br><br> On a more abstract level, it gives them the chance to discover their body, spatial awareness, and to learn
                how emotions, thoughts and ideas can be expressed through music and movements.</li><br>
                <li><b>"IT BUILDS CREATIVITY AND IMAGINATION".</b> A typical music and movement class usually calls upon kids to pretend. This enhances their imagination,
                and language. For example, pretending to flutter like butterflies gives children a chance to visualise and flex their imagination skills, as they translate
                their thoughts into actions.</li>
